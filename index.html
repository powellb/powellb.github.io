          <p align="justify">Prof. Brian Powell is a Physical Oceanographer in
          the Department of Oceanography at the University of Hawai&#8216;i at
          M&#257;noa. His research focuses on the understanding and prediction
          of the ocean environment, including physics and biogeochemistry,
          applications of machine learning in state estimation and prediction,
          and ocean observations and their design. He was the recipient of the
          2009 ONR Young Investigator award for his work on prediction and state
          estimation. The ocean and its climate is a dynamic, interconnected
          complex system that welcomes many backgrounds and fields. Ideas within
          the lab group are shared and debated openly with all discourse free of
          rigid hierarchies.

          <h2>Physics and Ecosystems</h2>
          <p align="justify">
            Work in the Powell lab is aimed to understand the physics and
            feedbacks that control the ocean, its geochemical cycle, and the
            ecosystems that form in each niche. These physical processes
            determine the health of everything from coral reefs to nearshore and
            pelagic fish stocks that feed humans.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            Over the past thirty years, the variability of extreme events has
            likely increased (prolonged marine heat waves, potentially stronger
            El Ni&ntilde;o impacts, etc.); however, the climate itself has not
            yet significantly shifted. Two crucial questions related to climate
            change are: (i) how will interannual&#8211;to&#8211;decadal
            variability change over the coming decades; (ii) and, when will
            climate change emerge as the dominant signal?
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            As the variability in the physics increase towards a new climate
            change signal, the impacts on the biogeochemistry and ecosystems may
            be profound. These changes will be felt from the single&#8211;cell
            planktons to the dinner&#8211;tables of families and reach from
            science to economics to social convention.

          <h2 style="color: black;">Simulations and Machine Learning</h2>
          <p align="justify" style="color: black;">
            To understand and forecast the ocean and its ecosystems, we rely
            upon large&#8211;scale, high&#8211;performance computing. We develop
            software tools for simulating the ocean and its environment, for
            data analysis, and for combining observations and models in
            mathematically consistent ways so that the models represent the
            observations of the ocean.
          </p>

          <p align="justify" style="color: black;">
            Machine Learning refers to a broad range of methods that constrain a
            model with observed behavior. From simple linear&#8211;regression to
            deep neural&#8211;networks, there exist many ways to combine models
            and data. Less than 1% of the ocean is observed, which means that
            traditional, statistics&#8211;based machine learning is an
            inappropriate tool: a na&iuml;ve neural-network lacks the
            observations to "learn" about the ocean. Physics-informed methods,
            such as 4D-Variational Data Assimilation, Ensemble Kalman Filters,
            and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are the methods that are
            required.
          </p>

          <p align="justify" style="color: black;">
            Our lab group strives to continue to be at the forefront of these
            techniques and utilizing them to blur any boundaries between models
            and observations. We look to quantify what observations actually
            "see" in the ocean, which observations improve our forecasting and
            understanding, and how machine&#8211;learning can supplement or
            replace our estimations of small&#8211;scale processes in the ocean.
